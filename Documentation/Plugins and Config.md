# Custom Frames
You can add a new frame in the settings of the plugin 
- Phind
	- Name: "Phind"
	- Ribbon icon: library
	- URL: https://phind.com/
- Pomofocus
	- Name: "Pomofocus"
	- Ribbon icon: alarm-clock
	- URL: https://pomofocus.io/
[Security Concern](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/security-of-the-plugins/7544/2) since Custom Frames uses electron.

# Obsidian Git
Enables source control view if you dont want to use a terminal

# StatusBar Pomodoro
All you need instead of pomofocus in a frame, since we also use tasks

# Tasks
Get each - [ ] task across the vault (or config on a tag), so you can show tasks in a "dashboard" note or in each project overview for example (you can query tasks and select on folders/notes)
